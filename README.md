# Metaheuristics

This repository hosts the analysis I performed as part of the assignment of the Metaheuristic class @ DSTI, during the S20 cohort.

The [folder Analysis](https://github.com/asonnellini/Metaheuristics/tree/master/Analysis) hosts: 

  - a [pdf document](https://github.com/asonnellini/Metaheuristics/blob/master/Analysis/Full_Analysis_Sonnellini.pdf) that details the steps of my analysis along with their outcome
  - a set of Jupyter notebooks with the code I produced to implement the solution of each problem
