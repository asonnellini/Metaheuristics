# Metaheuristics

This repository hosts the analysis I performed as part of the assignment of the Metaheuristic class @ DSTI, during the S20 cohort.

The folder Analysis hosts: 

  - a pdf document that details the steps of my analysis along with their outcome
  - a set of Jupyter notebooks with the code I produced to implement the solution of each problem
